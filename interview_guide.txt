%(This is just the interview guide for information, need to write it up more concisely)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tell me a little about the data sources you’ve been working with so far – have any been restrictive or hard to access?\begin{enumerate}
\item What did you do when you encountered the access restriction?
\item Did you ever consider going to another source, or encouraging data creators and curators to share their information somewhere less restrictive?
\item Did others you work with share your views and opinions? Can you provide any examples?
\end{enumerate}
\item What about good experiences – are there any data sources that are exemplary? \begin{enumerate}
\item What did they do  right?
\item Was there anything they could do better?\end{enumerate}
\item If you could design your own “dream” COVID data source, would there be anything else you’d like to see?
\item Are there any ethical issues you’re aware of, or have considered, with regards to this data sharing? 
\end{enumerate}
